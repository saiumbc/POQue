S. Immigration and Naturalization Service made a reasonable decision Wednesday in ruling that Elian Gonzalez, the 6 - year - old boy who survived an ill - fated migrant smuggling trip across the Florida Straits, should be reunited with his father back in Cuba. The decision will inflame anti - Castro Cubans in Miami, but Doris Meissner, the INS commissioner, made it clear that the service had followed established policy in the case. Moreover, by setting a Jan. 14 return date, the immigration service allowed Elian' s American relatives time to test the ruling in court. Elian was one of 13 Cubans who were trying to cross from Cuba to Florida six weeks ago on a 17 - foot aluminum powerboat when it capsized. Ten of those on board died, including his mother and stepfather. The boy clung to an inner tube for two days and was plucked from the Atlantic on Thanksgiving Day and brought ashore. He was immediately released into the custody of relatives in Miami _ and just as quickly embraced as a pawn in the poisonous estrangement between Fidel Castro' s regime and its opponents in exile.", "process_summary": "The U.
